        <p>Fine print: This is a quick and dirty Jeopardy clone. It has a few issues, like the Regex matching will fail if you use characters (like question marks) that regex can parse. Also, I'm doing a simple match on the typed answer. There's nothing like minimum percentage of match, so if you were to just type 'e' as your answer, there's a good chance you'll be marked correct. Any solutions have issues and won't be 100% accurate. Best thing to do would be to remove the input field and use this as a game with multiple people where you manually select if your answer was right or wrong. But ehh, I've wasted enough time on this project.</p>
